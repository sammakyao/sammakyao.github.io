          <p><b>Description</b><br>
            During my software engineering internship at the Ministry of Health’s Tanzania National Health Portal, we were a team 
            of about 20 developers who worked to enhance the data integrity and compliance of over 500,000 health records. 
            The Tanzania National Health Portal provides health services and information to over 60m+ people, supporting the 
            government’s digital transformation in healthcare. This was also my first time learning PHP and working with AWS 
            on a very large scale. I worked to ensure accurate and secure health data management. In addition to the backend, 
            I was also tasked with the development of responsive web designs to create an intuitive user interface. 
            In the end, our team’s work was instrumental in achieving an impressive 95% user satisfaction rate. 
            This experience strengthened my skills in managing large data sets, and creating user-friendly designs, and 
            have grown confident with the backend immensely.

            my ability to develop practical, real-world applications. I’m currently on project no: 66. I document these between
            Github and Gitlab.

            Developed a cellular automaton based on the 1970 zero-player 'Game of Life' using Java. The project implements 
            a two-dimensional array to simulate the evolution of cells, and a graphical user interface (GUI) built with 
            JavaFX (or Swing) to offer an interactive user experience. The game logic efficiently handles cell state transitions, 
            while the GUI allows users to adjust the grid and simulation speed. Version control and collaboration are managed through 
            Git and GitHub.

          <p><b>Description</b><br>
            Developed an ecological dynamic model simulating predator-prey interactions using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. 
            The project tracks population changes over time and outputs data using file I/O for persistence and analysis. 
            The real-time graphical visualization of the ecosystem is built with Java Swing, providing users with a dynamic 
            and interactive display of the simulation's progress. The simulation parameters are adjustable, allowing for various 
            ecological scenarios to be modeled. The project is managed and versioned using Git and shared on GitHub.

          <p><b>Role</b>: <span class="badge badge-primary">project</span></p>
          <p><b>Location</b>: MIT | Cambridge, MA | Fall 2019 </p>
          <p><b>Context</b><br> After taking 6.036 (MIT's introductory ML class), I developed an interest in
            reinforcement learning. RL is about training an agent to make a series of optimal decisions so that it's
            able to achieve some long-term objective. Examples of areas that RL has been applied include games,
            robotics, trading, advertising and many others.</p>
          <p><b>Description</b><br>
            For this project, my objective was to apply this learning technique to a simpler environment, namely,
            balancing a pole on a moving cart. A full description of the cartpole problem can be found <a
              href="https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/CartPole-v0">here</a>
          </p>
          <p><b>Tools</b>: python, openai gym</p>
          <p><b>Results</b>: This was my first RL project! It was more of a hands-on learning experience than anything
            else. </p>
