          <p><b>Description</b><br>
            During my software engineering internship at the Ministry of Health’s Tanzania National Health Portal, we were a team 
            of about 20 developers who worked to enhance the data integrity and compliance of over 500,000 health records. 
            The Tanzania National Health Portal provides health services and information to over 60m+ people, supporting the 
            government’s digital transformation in healthcare. This was also my first time working with AWS 
            on a very large scale. I worked to ensure accurate and secure health data management. In addition to the backend, 
            I was also tasked with the development of responsive web designs to create an intuitive user interface. 
            In the end, our team’s work was instrumental in achieving an impressive 95% user satisfaction rate. 
            This experience strengthened my skills in managing large data sets, and creating user-friendly designs, and 
            have grown confident with the backend immensely.

          <p><b>Role</b>: <span class="badge badge-primary">project</span></p>
          <p><b>Location</b>: Dar es Salaam, Tanzania | First High School Project </p>
          <p><b>Context</b><br>
            In Tanzania, out of eleven million students in government schools whose language of instruction is Swahili, only 750,000 students 
            complete their primary education every year. Consequently, many of these students will inevitably face setbacks while transiting 
            to their secondary education studies, where the English language is used for instruction in all schools. The education journey 
            of many Tanzanian kids is thus halted just in the very early stages. Millions of Tanzanian Children who do not gain secondary or 
            vocational training are then forced to engage in child labor, often in exploitative, abusive, or hazardous conditions, to 
            supplement income for their poor families. Therefore, the demand for a friendly Tanzanian English Language teaching aid is 
            rising due to student concerns, education subsidies, and a high number of students.
          </p>
           <p><b>Description</b><br>
            Developed an offline SMS-based search engine using Java to serve over 171,000 vocabulary definitions and translations to 
            Tanzanian students, addressing the educational challenges of transitioning from Swahili to English. The system integrates 
            an SMS modem and SIM card to receive and process requests via text messages, ensuring accessibility without internet connectivity. 
            The backend infrastructure utilizes a repurposed old CPU for data storage and query processing, supported by SQLite for 
            efficient local database management. Additional components include Arduino modules for prototyping, and Processing software 
            for building Java-based executable files to ensure system functionality. The system is powered by Android Studio for further 
            app development to enhance user experience on mobile platforms. This project achieved an 80% improvement in academic performance 
            for 200 students and won the National Young Scientists Tanzania Competition (Technology Category) out of 5,760 entries.
